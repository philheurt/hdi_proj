          <p>
            As we state in our 3 Laws of Data Protection, we are committed to protecting the privacy of your data. This Privacy Policy explains more specifically what information Evernote Corporation and its Group Companies (together, “Evernote,” “we” or “us”) collect and receive from Account Holders and End Users (“you”) through Evernote’s websites and applications, which we refer to collectively as “the Service.” The Service includes the Evernote Software.
            <br>
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h3>

          <h4 id="registration">Registration</h4>
          <p>To open your account, we collect and receive basic information like your email address.</p>

          <h4 id="service-usage">Service usage</h4>
          <p>We collect and log data on how you and others access and use Evernote, for example, the act of creating a note or sharing a note. </p>

          <h4 id="cookies">Cookies</h4>
          <p>Usage data may be collected through cookies, and similar technologies.<br>
            Cookies are small data files that a website you visit may save on your hard drive. They usually include an anonymous unique identifier. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses. <br>
            Evernote uses cookies and similar technologies to assist with functions such as user authentication, remembering user preferences, understanding how users use our Service, and managing and tracking the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. We also may include tracking pixels, which are small graphic images, in our email messages and newsletters to determine whether the messages were opened and if the links were clicked. In some cases, third parties may also get the opportunity to set cookies.
          </p>

          <h4 id="technical-data">Technical data</h4>
          <p>We collect the IP address you use to connect to the Service.
            We collect information about the number and type of devices you use to connect to the Service, as well as information about the operating systems on those devices (e.g., iOS, Android, Windows).
            Evernote stores your device's unique hardware identifiers (IMEI, SIM number, or other identifier) and description on our servers in order to:
            <ul>
              <li>Allow you to review and revoke devices from your account settings.</li>
              <li>Enable promotional account upgrades.</li>
              <li>Calculate anonymous aggregate statistics on the number of unique devices accessing the Evernote service.</li>
            </ul>

          <h4 id="user-content">User content</h4>
          <p>We built Evernote to help you remember and organize your ideas, thoughts, and memories. That means you can input, upload, or store in Evernote any text, images, and other data that you choose—we refer to that information as “Content”.
          </p>

          <h4 id="financial-info">Financial information</h4>
          <p>To process payments, depending on how you purchase a subscription to Evernote Plus, Evernote Premium or Evernote Business (each a “Paid Service”), we collect and receive your billing address and other payment information.
          </p>

          <h4 id="digital-content">Digital content</h4>
          <p>
            When you install, modify, or use an Evernote application, you may see permission requests or alerts regarding the device capabilities the application could potentially use. For example, on some versions of Android you will see a long, generic, technical list of device capabilities upon installation of the app, while on other versions of Android and iOS you will see device permission requests pop up as they are used in the app. Many of these capabilities may be turned on or off through your device settings or your Evernote account settings.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera and microphone</strong>: Evernote uses your device's camera and microphone when you choose to capture images, audio, or video into a note.</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar</strong>: Evernote uses your calendar information to automatically suggest note titles.</li>
            <li><strong>Contacts</strong>: Evernote uses your contacts to auto-complete email addresses when you share Content. Evernote may also display photos of your Evernote contacts (from their Evernote profiles) when they are viewing shared items.</li>
            <li><strong>Location</strong>: Evernote attaches your location information to new notes and uses your location information to suggest note titles.</li>
            <li><strong>Photos</strong>: Evernote accesses your photos when you add a photo to a note via camera capture or on-device photos.</li></ul>

          <h4 id="third-party-integration">Third party & Integration</h4>
          <p>When you connect your Evernote account with your LinkedIn or Gmail accounts, we may access your full name and profile photo from those services in order to display your name and photo to users with whom you share information. You can change these in your Evernote account settings. Evernote may also access your contact information to auto-complete email addresses when you share content.
          </p>

          <h3 id="collection-purpose">Data Collection Purposes</h3>
          <h4 id="product-improvement">Product improvement</h4>
          <p>We may collect actions you perform when using the Service (e.g., creating a note or sharing a note) to administer the Service and to improve the features and usability of the Service.</p>

          <h4 id="analytics">Analytics</h4>
          <p>
            We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to help us understand how you use our website, our mobile applications, our desktop clients, our browser extension products (such as Evernote Web Clipper), and our Save to Evernote button. By providing us with information about how you interact with our Service, these tools help us learn how to make the Evernote experience even better and customize our communications with you. On our website, for example, these technologies can tell us things like how you arrived at the site, if you have visited the site before, how long you stay on the site, and which pages you visit. They also provide us with general information about where in the world you may be located.The following analytics technologies are in use:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics</strong>: To learn more about Google Analytics and your privacy, visit the “How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps” page at <a href="www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Branch.io</strong>: To learn more about Branch.io and your privacy, visit <a href="https://branch.io/policies/#privacy">https://branch.io/policies/#privacy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Hotjar</strong>: To learn more about Hotjar and your privacy, visit <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/privacy">https://www.hotjar.com/privacy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Chartbeat</strong>: To learn more about Chartbeat and your privacy, visit <a href="http://chartbeat.com/privacy/">http://chartbeat.com/privacy/</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Rocketfuel.com</strong>: To learn more about Rocketfuel and your privacy, visit the “Privacy Policy for Web Surfers” page at <a href="https://rocketfuel.com/privacy/">https://rocketfuel.com/privacy/</a>.</li></ul>

          <h4 id="service-personalization">Service personalization</h4>
          <p>
            Functional cookies are necessary to enable portions of the Service and its features to work as intended. For example, we use cookies to help recognize and remember you when you are logged into the Service so we can maintain your settings and preferences, such as your language and region or your logged-in state. These cookies also may help us provide services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on our user forum. These cookies do not track your browsing activity on non-Evernote websites.<br>
            Also, we may collect actions you perform when using the Service (e.g., creating a note or sharing a note) to suggest Evernote features, products, and services that can enhance your use of the Service.<br>
            We use a number of technologies to help you get the most out of the Service. Our systems automatically analyze your data to power Evernote features and to continually improve the Service for you in a way that does not require anyone to look at your Content. This may include, for example:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Making sure you find what you’re looking for when you search your account.</li>
              <li>Showing you information most relevant to how you are or could be using the Service at a specific time or location.</li>
              <li>Suggesting actions for you to take based on information you’ve stored.</li>
              <li>Suggesting Evernote service features or products to you that we think will help you get the most out of our Service.</li>
              <li>For Evernote Business users, recommending people for you to collaborate with.</li></ul>


            <h4 id="ad-performance">Ad performance</h4>
            <p>
              We collect a unique ad tracking identifier (the Advertising Identifier or “IDFA” on Apple devices and the Google Advertising ID or “AID” on Android devices) from your device. These identifiers are unique to your device, but you can reset them or limit their use through your device settings, as described below. These identifiers do not contain your name or email address. We use these ad tracking identifiers together with our analytics technologies in order to inform our targeted advertising initiatives.<br>
              We contract with third-party advertising networks that use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your visits to and actions on certain pages of Evernote.com, your use of the Evernote applications, and whether you open certain emails we send you. We do this in order to serve advertisements for relevant Evernote products and services to you later, such as when you are on certain third-party sites, and to measure the performance of our messages. We do not share your personal information (i.e., your name or email address) or Content with a third party as part of this process.<br>
              We may use marketing automation services, such as Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Such services use cookies to provide us with information on how you interact with our website and marketing emails to help us refine our marketing efforts and provide more relevant information to you.
            </p>

            <h4 id="security">Security</h4>
            <p>
              We may collect your telephone number, if you choose to share it, to enable two-step verification to provide an additional layer of security for your account.<br>
              As part of our efforts to protect your account and the functionality of the Service, our systems may analyze the emails you send to and from your Evernote account and the notes you share to detect spam, malware, or other potential security concerns. If we determine that such material constitutes a <a href="https://evernote.com/legal/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> or <a href="https://evernote.com/legal/user-guidelines">User Guidelines</a> violation, we may block delivery of or unshare the problematic material, much like a spam filter works for your email inbox.<br>
              <a href="https://evernote.com/security/tips">Learn more</a> about steps you can take to protect your account, such as using strong passwords, two-step verification, and encryption.
            </p>

            <h4 id="fraud">Fraud detection</h4>
            <p>We may verify your email address and telephone number, if you choose to share it, to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse.
            </p>

            <h4 id="communication">Communication</h4>
            <p>
              To provide troubleshooting and customer support, our Customer Support team may need to access your information, such as your account email address and information about the Evernote application you are using.<br>
              In accordance with your communication preferences, we’ll occasionally contact you to announce new products and features we build for you, share tips for using Evernote to get more done, make special offers, and provide information about how Evernote works with products and services from our business partners.<br>
              Even if you unsubscribe from promotional emails or turn off in-app notifications, Evernote Business users will also continue to receive a daily summary of activity associated with their Business account.<br>
              Similarly, if we learn of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address, phone number or other contact information that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on our web site and/or via other communication platforms. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.
            </p>

            <h3 id="data-sharing">Data sharing</h3>
            <h4 id="third-party">Third party</h4>
            <p>Our website uses social media features (“Social Features”) provided by companies and services such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn and others (depending on what country you’re in) to enable you to share information with these channels. The Social Features are identified on our website by our display of the companies’ logos. These cookies are owned and controlled by third parties, and therefore the third parties – and not Evernote – are responsible for their use. As such, we can't guarantee that we have listed every cookie you might get from a third party since a third party could change these cookies at any time as their needs change.<br>
            When you visit a page on the Evernote website that contains Social Features, your browser establishes a direct connection to the applicable social network’s servers. The Social Features inform the social networks what pages you have accessed on Evernote’s site, and, if you are logged into the social network, your visit may be logged to your account on that service. For example, if you click the Facebook “Like” button, that information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored by them. Even if you are not logged into the social network, and do not click on a Social Feature on the Evernote site, there is still a possibility that a Social Feature can transmit your IP address and cookie information to the operator of the social network. We will not transmit information regarding your account contents to such social networks.<br>
            For information on the purpose and scope of data processing by a social network, as well as your options for protecting your privacy, please review the appropriate social network's privacy policy. For your convenience, below are links to the most commonly used Social Features you’ll see on the Evernote site.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Facebook</strong>: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy</a></li>

              An additional Social Feature on our Russian-language site is <a href="http://www.vk.com/">VK</a>, and an additional Social Feature on our Japanese-language site is <a href="https://www.hatena.com/">Hatena</a>.<br>

              We share your information with Service Providers who process data on our behalf, such as customer management systems. For example, these Service Providers help us operate, develop, and improve the features and functionality of the Service.<br>
              We require these providers to agree to strict data protection requirements in keeping with our privacy policy standards, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), and our commitments under our EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield certifications as discussed below. You can view the vendors we use to help us provide the Service on our <a href="https://evernote.com/privacy/vendors">Vendors page</a>.<br>
              We do not share your information with any third parties for their own advertising purposes.<br>
              In addition, Evernote enables you to use a variety of third-party services and applications that interact with the Service, and you should review the access rights you provide to those services or applications, as you may enable them to access or extract your Content through your agreements with those parties. More information on the nature of these permissions may be found on our <a href="https://evernote.com/privacy/third-party-apps">Third Party App Permissions</a> page.<br>

              In addition, we may share with partners or Service Providers a hashed identifier to serve you relevant Evernote ads when you visit partners’ and providers’ websites, applications or platforms. We may, for instance, participate in the Google Adwords Remarketing, <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405">Twitter Tailored Audience</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/341425252616329">Facebook Custom Audience services</a>. To learn more about the privacy controls that Google, Twitter and Facebook offer and honor for those respective services, please visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">here</a> for Google, <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405">here</a> for Twitter, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1415256572060999">here</a> for Facebook. <br>

              We also may share information about you with third parties whenever you consent to or direct such sharing. This includes, for example, if you connect your Evernote account with a third-party app in our App Center.<br>
              Evernote works with a number of third-party applications and services. In some cases, Evernote will partner with another company to provide an integration. In addition, in our <a href="https://appcenter.evernote.com/">App Center</a>, you can find a number of third-party applications and services that work with Evernote. If you connect your Evernote account to these third-party services, you may be giving the partner access to some or all of your data, including, in some cases, your Content.<br>

              Providing such access is entirely voluntary, and you’ll receive notice and must consent before such access is granted. You’ll always be able to check which applications or services are authorized to access your account by visiting the <a href="https://www.evernote.com/AuthorizedServices.action">applications page</a> in your account. You’ll also be able to turn off access from connected applications and services whenever you want.<Br>
              Please consider your selection of such applications and services, and your permissions, carefully. We encourage you to review each party’s contract terms and privacy policy.

            <h4 id="information">Information</h4>
            <p>
              If we become aware of a potential violation of our <a href="https://evernote.com/legal/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> or <a href="https://evernote.com/legal/user-guidelines">User Guidelines</a>, we may suspend or close your account until the problematic material is removed. Under such a circumstance, we would only look at the Content in your account if you give us consent or if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, including to protect the safety of you or any other person.<br>
              To test and improve our product offerings for our users, we use aggregated data that does not contain any personal information, does not identify any person, and cannot be connected to any specific user. This policy is not intended to apply to such anonymized/de-identified data.<br>
              In the event of a merger, sale, or reorganization of all or part of our business, information covered by this policy may be transferred in connection with that deal.<br>

              We vigilantly protect the privacy of your account. We will not disclose your information to law enforcement or other governmental authorities unless we believe it is required to comply with warrants, court orders, subpoenas, or other lawful government requests. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards of due process.<br>
              We narrowly interpret all information requests, and we only disclose Content in your account that is specifically responsive to a government warrant or where you have provided your explicit consent. In accordance with our <a href="https://evernote.com/legal/law-enforcement">user notice policy</a>, we will notify you if we believe we are compelled to comply with a third party’s legal demand for your information, and we routinely push back on government orders to delay user notice that we view as overly broad. You can find more information in our current <a href="https://evernote.com/privacy/transparency-report">Transparency Report</a>.<br>
              In addition, in rare cases, we may share your information as necessary to investigate or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or potential threats against persons, property or the systems on which we operate the Service, or as otherwise necessary to comply with our legal obligations.
            </p>

            <h4 id="financial-info2">Financial information</h4>
            <p>
              We share your information with Service Providers who process data on our behalf, such as credit card processors. For example, these Service Providers help us complete your payment transactions and fulfill your sales and support requests.
            </p>

            <h4 id="content">Content</h4>
            <p>
              You may share content with other users, who will be able to see your name, image and other personal information if you choose to share it.<br>
              You have control over who sees your Content. We limit the use of your Content to make sure that no one at Evernote can view it unless you expressly give us permission or it’s necessary to comply with our legal obligations. Specifically:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>To help refine or improve the technology, we may ask you for permission to review portions of your Content. For example, if a new feature suggests related notes that are relevant to your Content, we may give you an opportunity to provide us feedback on how well the feature is performing along with a sample of the Content in question, so we can make sure this feature provides appropriately tailored suggestions. Such access to your Content is done only with your express permission and is subject to strict confidentiality rules and data access controls. Choosing to give us such permission is completely voluntary.</li>
              <li>If you contact our Customer Support team for help with specific pieces of Content in your account (for example, if you can’t find a note you believe should be in your account), we may ask for your temporary permission to look at your Content. This permission terminates when the issue is resolved.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>If you send Evernote an error report and choose to attach application activity logs, please note that such logs may contain Content (for example, the title of a note or notebook). You may edit Content out of your activity logs before you send them to us.</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are features in Evernote that allow you to publish and share some of your notes and notebooks publicly, but these are optional. Any information that you post in these locations, or in our user forum, can be read, collected, and used by anyone and could enable others to send you unsolicited messages. Evernote enables you to determine whether to post personal or otherwise sensitive information to publicly accessible areas of our site, so you should carefully consider how you use the Service. Evernote is not responsible for any publication or use of any information you choose to post in these locations.<br>
                When you use Collaboration Features, people you share with may see your user profile.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>If you have not added any profile information, then you will be identified by the email address associated with your Evernote service account.</li>
                <li>If you are an Evernote Business user, other members of your Evernote Business account will see your full Evernote Business account profile. Evernote service users who are not in your Evernote Business account will only see your profile name and image.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>
              In addition, when you use Collaboration Features, the information you share is no longer private to you. For example, by publishing or sharing any portion of your Content, you may be enabling each recipient of the shared material to access, use, display, perform, distribute, and modify that material.<br>
              Depending on the permission levels you set when sharing Content, anyone who has access to the shared material may be able to see the Content, information about where and when the Content was created, as well as the note history, tags, and reminders associated with a particular note.
            </p>

            <h4 id="affiliated-business">Affiliated business</h4>

              You can delete your Content at any time, and you can stop using the Evernote service at any time. And as we promise in our third law of data protection, your data is portable. You can export your notes at any time.<br>
              If Evernote deactivates your account due to a TOS violation, then you may contact us to request deletion of your Content, and we will evaluate such requests on a case by case basis, pursuant to our legal obligations.

              You can configure your browser to accept cookies, reject cookies, or notify you when a cookie is being used. However, if you configure your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to use Evernote products or services that require you to sign in or take advantage of all the features of the Evernote service. In addition, information at the links we’ve provided in this document can help you disable specific cookies related to website performance and marketing.<br>

              You can configure your mobile operating system to limit or prevent the use or tracking of mobile identifiers such as IDFA and AID by toggling the relevant settings on your mobile device’s settings menu. Mobile identifiers are commonly used to recognize mobile devices in order to enhance user experiences, so disabling mobile identifier tracking may cause unintended errors during your use of Evernote mobile applications.<br>

              If you do not want to receive tracking pixels in emails we send you, you will need to disable HTML images in your email client, but that may affect your ability to view images in other email that you receive.<br>

            <h4 id="data-selling">Data selling</h4>
            <p>Evernote is not in the business of selling or renting your information.
            </p>

            <h4 id="data-transfer">Data transfer</h4>
            <p>
              When you use Evernote Software on your computing device, such as by using one of our downloadable applications, some of your data will be stored locally on that device.<br>

              When you sync your computing device with the Service, that data will be replicated on servers maintained in the United States. This means that if you store information in or submit data to the Evernote website or Evernote Software and sync such Evernote Software with the Evernote service, you acknowledge your personal information will be transmitted to, hosted, and accessed in the United States.<br>

              Data privacy laws or regulations in your home country may differ from, or be more protective than, those in the United States. We will collect, store, and use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, wherever it is processed.<br>

              If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, please note that we use standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission to transfer your personal Information from the EEA or Switzerland to the United States and other countries.<br>

              In addition, Evernote Corporation has certified its compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from EU member countries and Switzerland.<br>
            </p>

            <h4 id="data-retention">Data retention</h4>
            <p>
              Evernote's mission is to help you remember everything important in your life. In order to do that, we make the Content you store in Evernote readily accessible to you, until you make the decision to delete it.<br>

              If you delete your Content and then sync, it will no longer be accessible to you or others who may access the Service. The Evernote service’s back-up systems may retain residual copies of your deleted Content for up to one year due to the nature of those systems’ operations.<br>

              Evernote provides you with features that allow you to communicate and collaborate with other users. Please note that deleting your copy of these communications (such as messages) won't delete copies existing in the accounts of people you were interacting with.<br>

              For users who are inactive for extended periods of time, we may close your account to satisfy our obligations under applicable law, and in accordance with our data retention policy. If that happens, we will try to notify you before taking any action.

            <h4 id="eu">EU specifics</h4>
            <p><strong>A Note for our European Users about our Data Processing Grounds and Data Access Rights:</strong><br>

            The European Union's GDPR requires that we provide notice in a specific way to our European users about their privacy rights. We process Account Holder or End User personal information on one of three grounds, depending on the circumstances: (i) your affirmative consent, in which case you will have the right to withdraw consent at any time; (ii) contractual necessity; or (iii) our legitimate interest in providing the Service. In addition, we are required to list the data access right available to all users in a specific way.<br>
            You can request Evernote to provide you with information on how we collect, use, and store your personal information, including provide you with a copy of your personal information we store in Evernote.<br>

            You can request that we correct certain inaccurate information if you are no longer using the Service. <br>
            You can export your information from Evernote to a competing service. <a href="https://evernote.com/privacy">See our Third Law of Data Protection for more information</a>.<br>
            You can object to the processing of your information in certain cases, as well as request that Evernote not use your personal information for direct marketing purposes. Direct marketing includes emails which help us keep you informed about the latest improvements to our Service. <a href="https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/208313758">See our Help and Learning page on opting-out for more information</a>.<br>

            The Evernote Corporation has certified that in respect of all personal information it receives from the European Union and Switzerland in reliance on the Shield, it will adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfers, Security, Data Integrity & Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.

            If we ever need to use your personal information for a purpose that is materially different to the purposes we collected it for or that you later authorize, we will notify you and provide you with the opportunity to opt-out.<br>
            Under the Privacy Shield, Evernote Corporation will remain liable if its third-party service providers process your personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.<br>
