      <h3> What Personal Information About Customers Does Amazon.com Gather? </h3>
      <p>
        The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your Amazon experience.
        Here are the types of information we gather.
      </p>
      <ul id="GUID-1B2BDAD4-7ACF-4D7A-8608-CBA6EA897FD3__UL_8EF033712D1940059DB8D20670ABFD05">
        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item"> <strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. <a>Click here</a> to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you. </span>
        </li>

        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item"> <strong>Automatic Information:</strong> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Amazon.com or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Amazon.com on other Web sites. <a>Click here</a>  to see examples of the information we receive. </span>
        </li>

        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item"> <strong>Mobile:</strong> When you download or use <a >apps created by Amazon</a>  or our subsidiaries, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services. For more information about how to do this,<a>click here</a>. </span>
        </li>

        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item"> <strong>E-mail Communications:</strong> To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Amazon.com if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your <a>Customer Communication Preferences</a>. </span>
        </li>

        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item"> <strong>Information from Other Sources:</strong> We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. <a>Click here</a> to see examples of the information we receive. </span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3> What About Cookies? </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item">Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide features such as <a>1-Click</a> purchasing, <a>Recommended for You</a> , personalized advertisements on other Web sites (e.g., Amazon Associates with content served by Amazon.com and Web sites using Checkout by Amazon payment service), and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. </span>
        </li>

        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item">The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Amazon.com's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Amazon.com products and services that require you to Sign in. </span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3> Does Amazon.com Share the Information It Receives? </h3>
      <p>
        Information about our customers is an important part of our business,
        and we are not in the business of selling it to others.
        We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries Amazon.com, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item"> <strong>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</strong> We work closely with affiliated businesses. In some cases, such as Marketplace sellers, these businesses operate stores at Amazon.com or sell offerings to you at Amazon.com. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. <a>Click here</a> for some examples of co-branded and joint offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customer information related to those transactions with that third party. </span>
        </li>

        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item"> <strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. </span>
        </li>

        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item"> <strong>Promotional Offers:</strong> Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Amazon.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your <a>Customer Communication Preferences</a> . </span>
        </li>

        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item"> <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. </span>
        </li>

        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item"> <strong>Protection of Amazon.com and Others:</strong> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our <a>Conditions of Use</a> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. </span>
        </li>

        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item"> <strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. </span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How Secure Is Information About Me?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item">We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item">We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
        <span class="a-list-item">It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. <a>Click here</a> for more information on how to sign off.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?</h3>
      <p>Our site includes third-party advertising and links to other Web sites. For more information about third-party advertising at Amazon.com, including personalized or interest-based ads, please read our <a>Interest-Based Ads policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Which Information Can I Access?</h3>

      </p>

      <h3>What Choices Do I Have?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="a-list-item">As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such Amazon.com features as <a>Your Profile</a>, <a>Wish Lists</a>, <a>Customer Reviews</a>, and <a>Amazon Prime</a>.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="a-list-item">You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the <a>Which Information Can I Access?</a> section. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="a-list-item">If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your <a>Customer Communication Preferences</a>. (If you do not want to receive <a>Conditions of Use</a> and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of Amazon.com, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="a-list-item">If you do not want us to use personal information that we gather to allow third parties to personalize advertisements we display to you, please adjust your <a>Advertising Preferences</a>.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="a-list-item">The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.

      <p><strong>Information You Give Us</strong><p>
